        The dataset contains 6,409 cases with age, gender, height, weight, and
        body fat percentage, and 195 cases also include workout frequency, session
        duration, and workout type.

      <span class="text-bold">The Model</span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-normal">
        A Random Forest Regressor was used to train scikit-learn models for
        predicting body fat percentage and workout metrics. The other body metrics
        in the report, such as BMI, comes from known equations. A Random Forest
        Regressor is an ensemble machine learning model that builds multiple
        decision trees and combines their predictions to improve accuracy and
        reduce overfitting. It is capable of handling complex datasets, capturing
        non-linear relationships, and work well with both categorical and
        numerical data. Additionally, it is robust to noise and missing data,
        making it a reliable choice for real-world datasets.

      <br /><br />
      <span class="text-bold">Body Fat Prediction</span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-normal">
        For body fat prediction, the model achieves an overall R² of 0.89, indicating high accuracy. For males, it explains 73% of the variance in body fat (R² = 0.73) with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.25. For females, the R² improves to 0.85, and the MAE is lower at 1.82, demonstrating better performance for predicting body fat in women.
      </span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-normal">
        The predictions were most influenced by gender (weight = 0.46), followed by weight (0.34), age (0.11), and height (0.10), indicating that gender and weight are the strongest predictors of body fat percentage.
      </span>

      <br /><br />
      <span class="text-bold">Other Metric Calculation</span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-normal">
        Referencing reliable research paper equations, the other body metrics are calculated and displayed on the report page:
        <ul>
          <li>Body Fat Weight = Body Fat Percentage × Weight</li>
          <li>Fat Free Body Weight = (1 - Body Fat Percentage) × Weight</li>
          <li>Body Mass Index (BMI) = Weight / Height² [metric]</li>
          <li>Body Metabolic Rate (BMR) for Female = 447.593 + (9.247 × Weight) + (3.098 × Height) - (4.330 × Age)</li>
          <li>Body Metabolic Rate (BMR) for Male = 88.362 + (13.397 × Weight) + (4.799 × Height) - (5.677 × Age)</li>
          <li>Total Body Water = (Fat Free Body Weight × 0.73) / Weight</li>
        </ul>
      </span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-bold">Workout Prediction</span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-normal">
        For workout metrics, the predictions were less accurate. Workout frequency and session duration had moderate R² scores of 0.34 and 0.52, indicating limited predictive reliability. Predicting workout type was particularly challenging, with low precision and recall across categories and an overall accuracy of 23%, reflecting the difficulty in distinguishing workout types using the available features.
      </span>

      <br />
      <span class="text-normal">
        For workout metrics, the importance of features varied across prediction tasks:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Workout Type:</strong> Weight (0.29) and body fat percentage (0.28) were the most significant predictors, followed by height (0.21) and age (0.21), with gender (0.01) having minimal impact.</li>
          <li><strong>Workout Frequency:</strong> Body fat percentage (0.58) was the dominant factor, significantly outweighing weight (0.17), height (0.12), and age (0.12), while gender (0.006) contributed very little.</li>
          <li><strong>Workout Session Duration:</strong> Body fat percentage (0.63) was again the strongest predictor, followed by weight (0.14), height (0.11), and age (0.11), with gender (0.008) having negligible influence.</li>
        </ul>
